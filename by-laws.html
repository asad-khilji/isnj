        <h2>ISNJ Bylaws updates</h2><br>

        <p>Salaam ISNJ Members!</p><br>

        <p>The ISNJ Board has revised the existing Bylaws to strengthen the working of ISNJ. The proposed new ByLaws were communicated in the community forum (9/6 & 10/8) and in the Town Hall (10/29) to gain community feedback.</p><br>

        <p>As a final step we are looking to get the registered community members to ratify the new ByLaws electronically.</p><br>

        <p>The ISNJ Board has asked that an independent committee oversee this process and validate the results. The members of the previous Election Committee have come together to help for this specific task.</p><br>

        <p>Voting is open until 12/11. Thank you for your active participation in strengthening the working of our masjid.</p><br>

        <h1>Common Questions</h1><br>

        <h2>How will voting work?</h2><br>

        <p>We will follow the same principles as in the recent election. For the ratification results to be valid, quorum is required. This means 51% of registered members.</p><br>

        <p>There will be one vote per form entry. Members from the same household will need to individually complete their vote.</p><br>

        <h2>I don’t know what my registered email address is, or I don’t know who else is registered under my email address.</h2><br>

        <p>Email islamicsocietynj@gmail.com and we will get you the info you need.</p><br>

        <h2>What if I don’t agree with some portions of the proposal?</h2><br>

        <p>It’s a vote for Yes or No, so members will have to choose one.</p><br>

        <p>If you have questions on certain aspects, please email islamicsocietynj@gmail.com to get clarification.</p><br>

        <h2>What happens after I vote?</h2><br>

        <p>You will receive a confirmation to the email provided.</p><br>

        <h2>When will you share results?</h2><br>

        <p>Voting will end Dec 11th. The independent committee will take some time to validate the results and then publish on public forums.</p><br>

        <h2>What if we don’t reach quorum?</h2><br>

        <p>As with the election, the results will not be valid. We ask all members to participate & exercise their vote so that we can avoid this problem.</p><br>
